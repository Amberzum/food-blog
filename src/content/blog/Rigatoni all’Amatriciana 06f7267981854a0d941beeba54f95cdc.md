Pasta all’Amatriciana is my personal favourite of the classic Roman pasta dishes. As much as I love a carbonara, I can’t resist a rich tomato sauce.

I’m not bringing you the most authentic recipe in the world, but it is absolutely delicious.

I’m a garlic girl with the spice tolerance of a small child, so I go heavy on the garlic and light on the spice. I also prefer rigatoni over spaghetti or bucatini, as the shells hold onto that sauce _so_ well.

**Ingredients for 2 servings:**

**160g** dried rigatoni, or your pasta shape of choice

**2 tbsp** olive oil

**1 tbsp** tomato paste

**1** **tin** of whole cherry tomatoes _(Using whole tomatoes instead of chopped gives you great texture, but chopped works if you have that)_

**1/2** of a small white onion, diced

**4** cloves of garlic, finely chopped

**50g** of guanciale, thinly sliced and cut into lardons _(pancetta, or unsmoked bacon work too)_

**30g** parmesan or pecorino, grated

**A pinch** of chilli flakes, or more if you like more spice

Salt and pepper to taste

**Equipment:**

A large pot and a frying pan/skillet with a lid.

**Method:**

1. Fill your pot with water. Salt the water well, and start bringing this to a boil.

2. In your frying pan, heat the olive oil over a medium heat. Add the onion and guanciale, and fry for 2-3 minutes until the guanciale starts to turn golden and the onion softens slightly. Add the garlic and fry for another minute.

3. Make a little well in the pan to add in the tomato paste. Fry for a minute or two, until the colour darkens, then mix everything together.

4. Add in the tinned tomatoes, chilli flakes, and season with salt and pepper. Turn the heat down to low, and cover the pan to simmer.

5. Once your water is boiling, add in the rigatoni and cook for 2 minutes less than the package suggests.

6. Whilst the pasta cooks, check on the sauce every so often and start crushing the tomatoes with the back of a spoon as they soften up. You’ll soon have a chunky sauce.

7. Reserve a little of the pasta water, and drain your pasta. Mix the pasta and sauce together and stir over a low heat for a few minutes until well combined (_If your frying pan isn’t very deep, you may want to do this in your larger pot!)._

8. Grate half of your parmesan over the pasta and melt this into the sauce. You can add some of the reserved pasta water here if things need loosening up a little.

9. Serve up the pasta, grate over the remaining parmesan, and a little black pepper if you like, and enjoy!

I like to have mine with a little rocket on the side, as it’s peppery flavour works really well with this dish!
