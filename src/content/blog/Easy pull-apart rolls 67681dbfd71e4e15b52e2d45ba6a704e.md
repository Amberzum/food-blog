This dough recipe is a perfect base for any kind of squidgy bread roll application. They're perfect for sandwiches, burgers, sliders, you name it.

You could even add a dash of cinnamon and dried fruit to the mix to make fruit teacakes.

These rolls are simple and versatile, with little active baking time needed. What’s not to love?

- **330ml** warm water

- **7g** yeast

- **6g** salt

- **1 tsp** honey

- **1 tbsp** olive oil (plus more for the bowl)

- Baking tray

**Method**

1. Add the flour, yeast, sugar, salt into a bowl and give everything a mix.

2. Pour over the warm water and add in the honey. Mix with your dough whisk, a wooden spoon, or wet hands until the flour is fully incorporated and you have a shaggy dough.

3. Cover and leave to rest for half an hour.

4. Lightly oil your worktop and turn out the dough. Knead for 10-15 mins by hand, or 5-7 mins in a stand mixer. The dough will become tight and smooth.

5. Leave to rest in a clean, lightly oiled bowl for 1-1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.

6. Punch down the dough, and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll into a log and divide the dough using a bench scraper or sharp knife.

_The number of rolls you’re aiming for will depend on the size you prefer. For burger buns or sandwich rolls, I’d recommend 6, or you can go for 8-10 if you want a smaller dinner roll/slider bun._

7. Cup your hand into a c-shape around each piece of dough, and use a circular motion to gently shape the buns into tight balls.

8. Place each dough ball onto a baking tray. Keep them close together to create the pull-apart effect when baked. Cover to proof for another 45 minutes, until puffy and almost doubled in size.

9. Preheat the oven to 220c whilst the dough proofs.

10. Just before baking, choose any topping you’d like! Brush with a little milk and dust the tops with flour for a classic batch roll, or go for an egg wash and sprinkle on some sesame seeds to make burger buns.

11. Bake for 25-30 minutes until golden brown. The rolls should sound hollow when tapped.

12. Leave to cool completely before slicing. They will feel crisp right out of the oven, but they’ll soften up as they cool.

If you do manage to resist eating them all on the day they’re baked, these rolls keep well for 3-4 days in an air tight container, or tightly wrapped in plastic.

I would love to see your bakes over on Instagram if you decide to give these a go!
