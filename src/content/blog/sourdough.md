When I first started baking, I assumed making sourdough bread was going to be super involved, complicated and difficult. I guess it can be if you want it to be, but I don’t want that, I just want bread.

I’ve tried multiple methods and different timings etc. using this same dough, and it’s turned into bread every single time. Good bread, even! This means you can fit baking into your schedule and make it work around you.

I personally feed my starter in the morning to give it chance to rise, and start baking in the afternoon. I time it so that I can get the dough in the fridge before I go to bed, and bake it the next day.

I recommend checking out Mary Grace Bread and her [backwards bread](https://youtu.be/y4RDRECwZzM) recipe for an even more hands-off approach. It’s a higher hydration dough than this one, so you’ll get more holes in the bread, which you might prefer! All her recipes are beginner friendly and she really helped me learn that you can’t really go _toooo_ far wrong, and to trust the process more.

Mine is lower hydration which leaves you with fewer holes and a tighter crumb, which I prefer for toast and sandwiches. I also just find it easier to work with.

For 1 medium sized loaf, you will need:

- **110g** bubbly sourdough starter
- **200g** room-temperature water
- **375g** bread flour - You can use all white, or a combo! I like 300g white with 75g wholemeal. I’d add more water if you choose to do more/all wholemeal though, as it can take more moisture.
- **8g** salt

Equipment:

- Two bowls, a big one for mixing, and a smaller one for resting your dough to help it keep its shape. If you have a banneton instead, that’s great too!
- A dutch oven, or oven safe pot with a lid.
- Baking paper

1. In your big bowl, mix together your starter and water until you have a well combined, milky mixture.

2. Add in your salt and flour, and mix everything together until really well combined. Get in there with wet hands and squish everything together if you need to. You’ll end up with a slightly sticky, shaggy dough.

3. Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel or a lid (I often use a pan lid!) and leave it to rest for 45 minutes-1 hour.

4. Wet your hands. Grab an edge of your dough which will now be more relaxed and smooth. Stretch it out a little, and fold it into the centre of the dough. Turn the bowl a quarter turn, and do the same thing until you‘ve made it all the way around. Visuals [here](https://youtu.be/1DEKlBYimlQ) if you need them! Cover, and wait another hour.

5. Repeat this every hour or so for the next 4-6 hours. I know it sounds like a long time, but if you’re pottering around in the house it does fly by! Try let the dough proof for longer in cooler weather, but if you only have a few hours before you need to get the dough in the fridge, it’ll be fine.

_If you want to go out, or forget, and skip a few of the folds, it will also be fine. You’ll notice the dough get smoother each time you fold it, though. You’ll also notice the dough rising, and bubbles beginning to form. This is good and shows the yeast is getting to work!_

6. Lightly flour a work surface, and tip out your dough. Repeat the stretches and folds again, and then flip the dough over so it’s ‘seam-side down’ and you have the smooth side facing you. Cup the dough with both hands, and spin it around on the work surface to create tension and form a tight, neat ball of dough. Dust the top of the dough with flour.

7. Flour your smaller bowl, or banneton, and place the dough inside ‘seam-side up.’ I then like to pull the dough in a little more along the seam with my fingers to create even more tension. Cover the bowl, and leave this in the fridge overnight, or for up to 24-36 hours.

_The longer it stays in there, the more sour it will taste, but you also increase the risk of the yeast getting too tired to make the bread rise in the oven._

**Now, you’re ready to bake!**

1. Preheat your oven to 230c, or as high as it’ll go if it can’t get that hot, with your dutch oven inside. I leave the lid out whilst the oven preheats, as I will definitely try pick it up with my bare hands.

2. Whilst the oven preheats, turn out your dough onto a piece of baking paper slightly larger than it. This isn’t essential honestly, you can turn it out onto a floured work surface and drop it into the dutch oven with your hands, but this makes it easier (and safer!).

It should hold its shape, but if it doesn’t, feel free to turn it over and give it a few more folds and reshape it a bit. Just let it rest for an extra 10 minutes before scoring and baking if you do this.

3. With a sharp knife or razor blade, score the top of your dough in any way you like. Be creative, or go for a simple line across the top of the dough. You just need to give the steam an escape route so it doesn’t try and make one itself and make your bread look a bit funky.

4. Carefully transfer the dough to your (now very hot!) dutch oven, pop the lid on, and bake for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, remove the lid and continue baking for 10-20 minutes, or until the crust is the colour you want. A less golden crust will be softer, and a darker crust will be chewier and have more flavour.

5. Once the bread is baked to your liking, let it cool for at least an hour before cutting into it! I know warm bread sounds delicious, and it is, but it will make your loaf gummy if you don’t let the rest of that steam escape in its own time.

You did it! You made bread! Now you get to eat it, share it, enjoy it and feel smug about the fact you made it. Definitely experiment with the timings and find a method that suits you. I think it’s fun to see how it affects the final loaf, too.
